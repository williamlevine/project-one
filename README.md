<h2># project-one</h2>

<h3>Description: This project seeks to analyze various demographic indicators and lifestyle behaviors as they relate to the incidence of diabetes in the United States.</h3>
Diabetes research and data analysis is crucial as it addresses a global health crisis affecting millions of people. Diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and amputations. Understanding the disease's mechanisms, risk factors, and effective treatments, life style improvements is vital for improving patient outcomes, reducing healthcare costs, and preventing the onset of diabetes in at-risk populations. Research in this field also supports the development of new therapies, technologies, and public health strategies that can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the burden of diabetes on individuals and society.

<h3>Research Questions:</h3>

- What are the general demographic indicators that are correlated with diabetes?
	- Income
	- Education
	- Age
- How are these demographic indicators correlated with lifestyle choices?
	- Alchohol: 
	- Fruits and veg (2 variables): 
	- Cholesterol check: 
	- Exercise: 
	- BMI (continuous variable): 
- How is each lifestyle choice above correlated with diabetes outcome?
